# Harbinger

Harbinger is a hands-on learning project focused on building a customizable and educational TCP networking library in Rust. Starting with a simple async echo server powered by tokio, the project progressively replaces high-level abstractions with custom logic to explore TCP fundamentalsâ€”handshakes, headers, packet parsing, and more. Harbinger isn't about production-grade networking; it's about tinkering, breaking things, and understanding how they work from the ground up. Join the journey to decode TCP and build something truly unique!
